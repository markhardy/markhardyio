                What do I do?
            </h1>
            <p>
                I'm a full stack web developer meaning I can make the whole banana. If your team
                already uses Agile processes then I'll fit right in.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am currently working through my consultancy, <a href="https://orangegrovedigital.com">
                Orange Grove Digital</a>. Feel free to <a href="mailto:markhardy.dev@gmail.com">
                contact me here</a> or through Orange Grove.

            <h1>
                What's my schedule?
            </h1>
            <p>
                I love my work, but not 24 x 7 x 365. I work on client projects Monday through 
                Thursday 9am - 5pm eastern time.
            </p>
            <h1>
                How much do clients participate when working with me?
            </h1>
            <p>
                At minimum, I like to have a phone call on Thursday afternoons to go over what's
                been completed that week and is on deck for the coming week. This is also an 
                opportunity for me to receive feedback on what's been already complete.
            </p>
            <p>
                I use Basecamp so that clients can track their projects. I encourage whatever level 
                of involvement my clients would like to have.
            </p>
            <h1>
                Any dealbreakers?
            </h1>
            <p>
                If any of the following are true, we are probably not a good fit.
            </p>
            <ul>

                    You're looking for a commodity coder.

                <li>
                    You don't think design is important.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You'd like to pay with equity.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h1>
                What's my rate?
            </h1>
            <p>
                I work on large projects at a rate of $2,880.00 per week.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also work on monthly retainers of 16 or 32 hours for $1,760.00 and $3,520.00 
                respectively.
            </p>
            <h1>
                Do you have a team?
            </h1>
            <p>
                I do.
            </p>
            <p>
                For projects that require additional skillsets, I can loop in some extremely
                skilled and experienced teammates who I've been working with since at least 2016.
